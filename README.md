## Hi there, I'm [Van Le] üëã

## üë®‚Äçüíª About me
As a Fullstack Developer at TopCV Vietnam, I leverage my skills in React Native, Golang, and Vue to create web applications, tools, and mobile apps that help job seekers create professional and attractive CVs. I joined TopCV in Mar 2022, after working as a Fullstack Developer at OpenCommerce Group and FPT Software, where I contributed to the development of Shopbase, a leading e-commerce platform, and various outsource projects for Softbank, a global technology giant. I have over four years of work experience in the field of information technology, and I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from FPT University, one of the top universities in Vietnam. I am passionate about building innovative and user-friendly solutions that solve real-world problems and create value for customers and stakeholders. I am always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, and to collaborate with other developers and engineers to deliver high-quality products and services.
